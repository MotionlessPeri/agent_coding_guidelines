# Agent Lifecycle Guidelines

## Before Starting Any Task

1. Read the mandatory documents in the order specified by the project's AGENTS.md.
2. Confirm which subsystem or component is being changed before touching code.
3. If the project has a progress/plan document, check current state before proceeding.

## Autonomous Actions (Permitted Without User Confirmation)

The agent may perform the following autonomously when required by the task:

- Save and close the editor before a rebuild.
- Run a cold rebuild (compile) after plugin or C++ code changes.
- Restart the editor/server after a rebuild.
- Stage files and create commits **only when the user has explicitly requested a commit**.

## Actions Requiring User Confirmation

Always confirm with the user before:

- Force-pushing or resetting git history.
- Deleting files, branches, or database tables.
- Pushing to a remote repository.
- Creating or closing issues/PRs.
- Any action visible to others or affecting shared infrastructure.

If in doubt, ask first. The cost of asking is low; the cost of an unwanted action is high.

## Validation Before Completion

- Never claim work is "done" or "fixed" without running verification.
- Evidence before assertions: run the build, run the tests, check the logs.
- If build or tests fail, diagnose and fix — do not report completion.
- For tool/command additions: verify both the implementation layer and interface layer.

## Handling Blockers

- If an approach is blocked, do not retry the same action in a loop.
- Consider alternative approaches or ask the user for direction.
- Do not use destructive actions (e.g., `--no-verify`, `reset --hard`) as shortcuts.
